  Jay Miner, father of the Amiga, cut his graphics teeth designing the TIA chip
  in the Atari 2600. I'd played a few VCS games on a cousin's system as a kid,
  but I never really appreciated the power locked within the machine. Sure, it
  only had a 1.19 MHz 6502 with it's wings clipped, and 128 bytes (!) of RAM,
  but TIA, synced to the cathode beam, allowed incredible feats to be
  achieved.Hereâ€™s a few videos about the hardware, and developing software for
  the platform.

Jay Miner, father of the Amiga, cut his graphics teeth designing the [TIA][0] chip in the Atari 2600\. I'd played a few VCS games on a cousin's system as a kid, but I never really appreciated the power locked within the machine. Sure, it only had a 1.19 MHz 6502 with it's wings clipped, and 128 bytes (!) of RAM, but TIA, synced to the cathode beam, allowed incredible feats to be achieved.  
Here's a few videos about the hardware, and developing software for the platform.
